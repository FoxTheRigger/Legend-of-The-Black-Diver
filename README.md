# Legend of The Black Diver (LoTBD) was the first game 2D game I made in Java.

The current version is more of a testing place, the game still has a ton of bugs. (I'm not working on this anymore)

The game was more of a Deepwoken lore fan-game, it featured a custom character named Selim who was on his way to find the secrets of "The First Black Diver" and acquire his armour in the end.
